# Student Gaming Network showcase

This is a simple showcase website I put together for an association I am working with to learn how to use ZURB Foundation and SASS.

To all the the non French readers, you have all my apologies since half of my comit messages are in French...

I know it is quite not the regular way to use Foundation for this, but hey : I'm still learning !
